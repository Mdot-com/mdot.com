Massive star evolution is dominated by key physical processes such as mass loss, convection and rotation, yet these effects are poorly constrained, even on the main sequence. We utilise a detached, eclipsing binary HD166734 as a testbed for single star evolution to calibrate new MESA stellar evolution grids. We introduce a novel method of comparing theoretical models with observations in the `Mass-Luminosity Plane', as an equivalent to the HRD (see Higgins &amp; Vink 2018). We reproduce stellar parameters and abundances of HD166734 with enhanced overshooting (α<SUB>ov</SUB>=0.5), mass loss and rotational mixing. When comparing the constraints of our testbed to the systematic grid of models we find that a higher value of α<SUB>ov</SUB>=0.5 (rather than α<SUB>ov</SUB>=0.1) results in a solution which is more likely to evolve to a neutron star than a black hole, due to a lower value of the compactness parameter.
