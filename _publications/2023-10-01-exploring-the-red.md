Red supergiants (RSG) are key objects in studying the evolution of massive stars and their endpoints, but uncertainties related to their underlying mass-loss mechanism have stood in the way of an appropriate framework for massive star evolution thus far. In this work, we analyse a recently uncovered empirical mass-loss "kink" feature and we highlight its similarity to hot star radiation-driven wind models and observations at the optically thin-to-thick transition point. We motivate a new RSG mass-loss prescription that depends on the Eddington factor, Γ, (including both a steep luminosity, L, dependence and an inverse steep mass, M<SUB>cur</SUB>, dependence). We subsequently implement this new RSG mass-loss prescription in the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that our physically motivated mass-loss behaviour naturally reproduces the Humphreys-Davidson limit without the need for any ad hoc tweaks. It also resolves the RSG supernova "problem". We argue that a universal behaviour that is seen for radiation-driven winds across the HR diagram, independent of the exact source of opacity, is a key feature of the evolution of the most massive stars.
