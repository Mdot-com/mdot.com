Strong metallicity-dependent winds dominate the evolution of core He-burning, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, which eject both H and He-fusion products such as <sup>14</sup>N, <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>16</sup>O, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>22</sup>Ne, and <sup>23</sup>Na during their evolution. The chemical enrichment from cWRs can be significant. cWR stars are also key sources for neutron production relevant for the weak s-process. We calculate stellar models of cWRs at solar metallicity for a range of initial Helium star masses (12–50 M<sub>☉</sub>), adopting recent hydrodynamical wind rates. Stellar wind yields are provided for the entire post-main sequence evolution until core O-exhaustion. While literature has previously considered cWRs as a viable source of the radioisotope <sup>26</sup>Al, we confirm that negligible <sup>26</sup>Al is ejected by cWRs since it has decayed to <sup>26</sup>Mg or proton-captured to <sup>27</sup>Al. However, in Paper I, we showed that very massive stars eject substantial quantities of <sup>26</sup>Al, among other elements including N, Ne, and Na, already from the zero-age-main-sequence. Here, we examine the production of <sup>19</sup>F and find that even with lower mass-loss rates than previous studies, our cWR models still eject substantial amounts of <sup>19</sup>F. We provide central neutron densities (N<sub>n</sub>) of a 30 M<sub>☉</sub> cWR compared with a 32 M<sub>☉</sub> post-VMS WR and confirm that during core He-burning, cWRs produce a significant number of neutrons for the weak s-process via the <sup>22</sup>Ne(α,n)<sup>25</sup>Mg reaction. Finally, we compare our cWR models with observed [Ne/He], [C/He], and [O/He] ratios of Galactic WC and WO stars.
