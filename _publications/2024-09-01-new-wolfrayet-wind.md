Strong metallicity-dependent winds dominate the evolution of core He-burning, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, which eject both H and He-fusion products such as $^{14}$N, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{19}$F, $^{22}$Ne, and $^{23}$Na during their evolution. The chemical enrichment from cWRs can be significant. cWR stars are also key sources for neutron production relevant for the weak s-process. We calculate stellar models of cWRs at solar metallicity for a range of initial Helium star masses (12-50 $\rm M_{\odot }$), adopting recent hydrodynamical wind rates. Stellar wind yields are provided for the entire post-main sequence evolution until core O-exhaustion. While literature has previously considered cWRs as a viable source of the radioisotope $^{26}$Al, we confirm that negligible $^{26}$Al is ejected by cWRs since it has decayed to $^{26}$Mg or proton-captured to $^{27}$Al. However, in Paper I, we showed that very massive stars eject substantial quantities of $^{26}$Al, among other elements including N, Ne, and Na, already from the zero-age-main-sequence. Here, we examine the production of $^{19}$F and find that even with lower mass-loss rates than previous studies, our cWR models still eject substantial amounts of $^{19}$F. We provide central neutron densities (N$_{n}$) of a 30 $\rm M_{\odot }$ cWR compared with a 32 $\rm M_{\odot }$ post-VMS WR and confirm that during core He-burning, cWRs produce a significant number of neutrons for the weak s-process via the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction. Finally, we compare our cWR models with observed [Ne/He], [C/He], and [O/He] ratios of Galactic WC and WO stars.
