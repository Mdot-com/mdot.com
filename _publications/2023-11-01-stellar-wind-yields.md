The most massive stars provide an essential source of recycled material for young clusters and galaxies. While very massive stars (VMSs, M& gt; 100 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) are relatively rare compared to O stars, they lose disproportionately large amounts of mass already from the onset of core H-burning. VMS have optically thick winds with elevated mass-loss rates in comparison to optically thin standard O-star winds. We compute wind yields and ejected masses on the main sequence, and we compare enhanced mass-loss rates to standard ones. We calculate solar metallicity wind yields from MESA stellar evolution models in the range 50–500 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, including a large nuclear network of 92 isotopes, investigating not only the CNO-cycle, but also the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles. VMS with enhanced winds eject 5-10 times more H-processed elements (N, Ne, Na, Al) on the main sequence in comparison to standard winds, with possible consequences for observed anticorrelations, such as C-N and Na-O, in globular clusters. We find that for VMS 95 per cent of the total wind yields is produced on the main sequence, while only ~ 5 per cent is supplied by the post-main sequence. This implies that VMS with enhanced winds are the primary source of <SUP>26</SUP>Al, contrasting previous works where classical Wolf-Rayet winds had been suggested to be responsible for galactic <SUP>26</SUP>Al enrichment. Finally, 200 M<SUB>☉</SUB> stars eject 100 times more of each heavy element in their winds than 50 M<SUB>☉</SUB> stars, and even when weighted by an IMF their wind contribution is still an order of magnitude higher than that of 50 M<SUB>☉</SUB> stars.
