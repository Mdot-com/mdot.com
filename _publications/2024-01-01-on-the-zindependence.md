The temperature independent part of the Humphreys-Davidson (HD) limit sets the boundary for evolutionary channels of massive stars that either end their lives as red supergiants (RSGs) or as the hotter blue supergiants (BSGs) and Wolf-Rayet stars. Recent downward revision of most luminous RSGs the Galaxy below log(L / L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) ≈ 5.5, more in line with the Magellanic Clouds, might hint towards a metallicity (Z)-independent HD limit. We present MESA single star models in the 15-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> range and study the different Z-dependent processes that could potentially affect the location of the upper luminosity limit of RSGs.
