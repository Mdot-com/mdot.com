Very massive stars (VMS) dominate the physics of young clusters due to their extreme stellar winds. The mass lost by these stars in their winds determine their evolution, chemical yields and their end fates. In this contribution we study the main-sequence evolution of VMS with a new mass-loss recipe that switches from optically-thin O star winds to optically-thick Wolf-Rayet type winds through the model independent transition mass loss.
